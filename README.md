The **Patrons Account Information API (PAIA)** is a HTTP based programming
interface to access library patron information, such as loans, reservations,
and fees. 

This git repository, hosted at http://github.com/gbv/paia, contains a 
preliminary specification. The master file is `paia.md` with bibliographic
references in `references.bib`.

A website with snapshots of the specification is included in the `gh-pages`
branch, visible at http://gbv.github.com/paia.

Both the specification and the website are written in
[Pandocâ€™s Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html).
There is a `Makefile` in the `master` branch to create HTML and additional output formats.

*Feel free to implement, comment, and edit! A bug tracking system is available
at https://github.com/gbv/paia/issues.*
