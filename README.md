The Patrons Account Information API (PAIA) is a HTTP based programming
interface to access library patron information, such as loans, reservations,
and fees. This git repository contains a preliminary specification, hosted
at http://github.com/gbv/paia. The master file `paia.md` is written in
[Pandoc Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html)
which can be converted to HTML and other formats (see `Makefile`).
