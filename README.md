The **Patrons Account Information API (PAIA)** is a HTTP based programming
interface to access library patron information, such as loans, reservations,
and fees. 

This git repository, hosted at http://github.com/gbv/paia, contains a 
preliminary specification. A website with snapshots of the specification
is included in the `gh-pages` branch, visible at http://gbv.github.com/paia.

Feel free to implement, comment, and edit! A bug tracking system is available
at https://github.com/gbv/paia/issues.

Both the specification and the website are written in
[Pandocâ€™s Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html).
There is a `Makefile` in each branch which creates HTML and additional output formats.
